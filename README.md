# Spotify Playlist Stats
This code computes some interesting statistics for Spotify playlists.

It currently works for collaborative playlists, and will need to be slightly altered for single user playlists.

Rather than using the Spotify API itself, this is meant to work with CSV data output by [Exportify](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify).
